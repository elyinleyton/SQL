-- I have uploaded a SAles data set to SQLiteStudio to begin querying data, the idea is to demonstrate how a data analyst solves day-to-day real problems in an organization.

-- First, We start with retrieving all data from two tables, this will help us identify the type of data we have inside the tables, and it can also help us identify the messy/missing data.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers;

--  As data analysts we will encounter many questions, therefore here are some examples.

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderId) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
-- ANSWER: 9681

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)= 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
--Answer: 379

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

-- In this case we must use JOIN to merge two table in order to answer this request.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
-- Many ways to solve it.
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

SELECT DISTINCT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc limit 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price) as avgspent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE quantity >= 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
